# Hi, I'm Nina!

I'm a recent grad in Computational Neuroscience with a passion for using biologically inspired mechanisms to build human-like AI. I use machine learning to model decision-making, solve real-world problems, and explore how humans and AI learn differently.

## What I Do
- ðŸ§ª Machine Learning Research
- ðŸ§¬ Modeling human behavior with RNNs
- ðŸŽ® Game-based learning environments
- ðŸ“Š Data Science & Analysis

## Tools I Use
Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Git, Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills:

- **[rnn-human-learning-thesis](link)**: My senior thesis in Computational Neuroscience, training RNNs on puzzle game data to explore whether AI can replicate human "leaps of insight" in sequential decision-making.
- **[gan-nn-final-project](https://github.com/nina-mizrahi/gan-nn-final-project)**: A team project implementing Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN) architectures from scratch in PyTorch, trained on MNIST digits. Includes evaluation using FID and SSIM image quality metrics, model checkpointing, and visualization of training dynamics.

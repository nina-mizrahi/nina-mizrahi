# 👋 Hi, I'm Nina!

I'm a recent grad in Computational Neuroscience with a passion for using biologically inspired mechanisms to build human-like AI. I use machine learning to model decision-making, solve real-world problems, and explore how humans and AI learn differently.

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🧪 Machine Learning Research
- 🧬 Modeling human behavior with RNNs
- 🎮 Game-based learning environments
- 📊 Data Science & Analysis

## 🧰 Tools I Use
Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Git, Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## 📌 Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills:

- **[rnn-human-learning-thesis](link)**: My senior thesis in Computational Neuroscience, training RNNs on puzzle game data to explore whether AI can replicate human "leaps of insight" in sequential decision-making.

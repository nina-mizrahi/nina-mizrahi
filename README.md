# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nina!

I'm a recent grad in Computational Neuroscience with a passion for using biologically inspired mechanisms to build human-like AI. I use machine learning to model decision-making, solve real-world problems, and explore how humans and AI learn differently.

## ðŸ§  What I Do
- ðŸ§ª Machine Learning Research
- ðŸ§¬ Modeling human behavior with RNNs
- ðŸŽ® Game-based learning environments
- ðŸ“Š Data Science & Analysis

## ðŸ§° Tools I Use
Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Git, Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ Featured Projects
Here are a few projects that showcase my skills:

- **[hexxed-rnn-model](link)**: Modeling human-like learning in a custom puzzle environment.
- **[image-caption-generator](link)**: An encoder-decoder model trained on the COCO dataset to generate natural image captions.
- **[covid-vaccine-predictor](link)**: Predicting vaccine acceptance using logistic regression and random forests.
